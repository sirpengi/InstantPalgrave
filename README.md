## Setup dev

Create a python3(.8??) virtualenv and then:

```bash
# You need root to install portaudio
pip install -r requirements.txt
# On Ubuntu / PiOS / anything with apt (except Termux):
apt-get install portaudio19-dev
# On Fedora
dnf install portaudio-devel
# dev or devel is for development i.e. stable I guess
```

and then:

```bash
python3 palgrave.py
```
On crostini (linux vm in chrome os) you first need to:
```bash
sudo apt install espeak alsa-utils
```

On windows, use manual setup.

There are other bot modes you can run by specifying the bot implementation:

```bash
python3 palgrave.py backwards
```

Supported implementations are `palgrave` (default, if you left blank), `echo`, `reverse`, and `backwards`.

If you are not going to use Spotify, this is all you need.

If you are using Spotify:
* First: You need Premium for it to work
* Second: go to https://developer.spotify.com
* Third: tap Dashboard then Sign In
* Fourth: create an app, set the redirect_uri to https://kaiete.uk/InstantPalgrave/spotify/done
* Fifth: put credentials into settings.ini (these will never be shared with anyone else, ever. Never enter your Spotify password here.)
* Sixth: launch Palgrave and say 'enable music'
* Palgrave will guide you through the steps.

*Deezer support may be added later.*

If you are using "what's the weather":
* First: go to settings.ini and set `city` to your city.

If you are helping with the development:
* First: go to settings.ini and set `debug` to `on`.

***Never*** commit your personal settings.ini file.
